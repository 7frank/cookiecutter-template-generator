# overview

A meta generator for [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)

- initial goal: have a bare MVP working that takes a configuration file, which will create a cookiecutter template from existing source (or project), which again can be used with cookiecutter to create a new project.

# TODO

- MVP
- create cli with esrun, cmd-ts & zod
